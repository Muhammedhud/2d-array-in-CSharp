// in this Code I show you how to usea @d array in C#

string[,] Car = new string[2, 2]; // first we make a string avay the we write this is a 2d array next we make 2 split and 2  line
{
    Car[0, 1] = "Toyota "; // we say the car in split 0 and in line 1 is toyota
    Car[0, 0] = "Audi ";

    Car[1, 0] = "Supra";
    Car[1, 1] = "SUV";
